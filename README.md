**Project development log:**
Day 1 (26 October 2025):
Created this repository in GitHub to document my first coding project. I roughly planned the general flow of my program and laid out the key features I must have in my program. Created the menu of the application and the function to add tasks.

Objective for this project: I want to make a highly functional command-line application which provides users a platform to be able to save their tasks seamlessly and be as user-friendly as possible to ensure they can manage tasks easily

Future hopes for this project's advancement:
1. Making it GUI when I have the skills then
2. Storing the tasks in a more robust manner
3. Adding more interactive functions like buttons and text boxes
4. 
5. 
6.
